#Need version 3.9 of Python

#pip install pandas, sklearn

#STEP 1 train our model

# CSV parser will get the sentitment and the sentence associate, from the csv file (dataset).
# We'll finally have an array of sentence and an array of sentiment?

    csv_reader = csv.reader(my_file, delimiter=',')

# TEST #
# tmp = pd.DataFrame([model.coef_], columns=sorted(vectorizer.vocabulary_.keys()), index=['coef']).T

# Here we create the pipeline
# First we create our vectorizer, who is able to remove the stop_word
# We are using the LinearRegression() model from sklearn

# Tokenization / Vectorization
# This Countvectorizer will transform our sentences in vector
# will split each sentence in words (without stop_word),
# and will finally create a matrix like this.
#
#        amazing  annoying  beautiful  gift  hate  idiot  love  stupid  ugly
# text1        1         0          1     1     1      0     1       0     0
# text2        0         1          0     0     1      1     0       1     1


pipe = make_pipeline(
    CountVectorizer(stop_words='english', min_df=200, max_df=0.5),
    LinearRegression()
)

# Here we give to our model:
# - Our sentence array
# - Our sentiment array (composed with -1 and 1)
pipe.fit(sentence, sentiment)

#negative amazon commentary about an harry potter book
print(pipe.predict(["I am very disappointed, I received a book with damaged corners"]))

#positive amazon commentary about an harry potter book
print(pipe.predict(["I'm frankly not disappointed, it's quite the opposite, I could not have hoped for better."]))

#STEP 2 Evaluate this model
